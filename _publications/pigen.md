abstract: "Discovering materials with previously unreported crystal frameworks is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space."
